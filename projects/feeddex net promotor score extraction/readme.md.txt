This Python code extracts feedback data from the Feeddex API and calculates the grade customers leave as feedback, and the Net Promoter Score (NPS) per region per month. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a powerful metric that can provide invaluable insights into customer loyalty and satisfaction. When used effectively, it can significantly impact a business's performance.   

The code performs the following steps:

Initialization:

Imports necessary libraries like requests for API calls, json for working with JSON data, and pyspark.sql for data processing.
Users need to define the Feeddex API root URL, organization name, and username/password (assumed to be retrieved securely over Databricks by using Azure Key Vault). The correct organization name, user name and password will be provided by Feeddex.

Feeddex API Interaction:

Creates a FeeddexAPI class to handle API interactions.
The class authenticates with the Feeddex API using the provided credentials and retrieves a token.
It then fetches feedback data for the current month using a GET request.
Spark Data Processing:

Creates a FeedbackDataProcessor class to process the retrieved data using Apache Spark.
Defines schemas for feedback and unit data.
Provides functions to parse dates and timestamps from the API response.
Processes the feedback data, creating a DataFrame with structured columns.
Joins the feedback DataFrame with a hypothetical unit DataFrame (assumed to contain unit names).
Calculates NPS metrics like average value, NPS score, and the number of promoters, passives, and detractors per region and month.
Data Display:

Assumes a SparkSession named spark is already running.
Creates a FeedbackDataProcessor instance using the SparkSession.
Calls the process_data method on the processor, providing the extracted feedback and unit data.
This method generates two DataFrames:
processed_df: Contains detailed feedback data with additional columns like region name.
summary_df: Contains NPS summary statistics grouped by region, year, and month.
Displays both DataFrames using a placeholder display function.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to interact with the Feeddex API, process the retrieved feedback data using Spark, and calculate NPS to measure customer satisfaction for a specific organization.
