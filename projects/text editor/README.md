# TxtEditor
This project is intended to be a text creating and editing program. The purpose of it is to read or create .txt files, and write or replace text. When the user is done making adjustments, analytics will be provided over the txt file.

Once downloaded and put in the desired folder (containing existing .txt files or not), the user is able to run the program on which will be asked what the user's intents are. Want to read a .txt file or create a new .txt file? If the user chooses to read a .txt file, the user is prompted with .txt files known in the current directory. When a user wants to create a .txt file, the user is prompted with lines on which text can be added to. It is also possible in both options to replace text if you want to make corrections to existing text. This can be done either for single occurrences or for all occurrences in the text. Once the user is done creating, reading, or modifying text, the user types "exit" on which the program exits and saves the changes to the .txt file. Finally, analytics are provided, such as: text file, number of characters, sentences, words, lines and the total occurrences replaced.
