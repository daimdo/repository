This code is designed to automate the process of downloading, extracting, processing, and saving climate data and degree days for multiple regions, making it easy to analyze and visualize the data.

Degree days are used to calculate energy consumption. They are used to calculate when it is most likely necessary to heat the house. This usually concerns gas consumption, unless you heat your home with electricity. When you see "Degree Days" = 3 in the Dataframe on a particular day, it tells you that the daily mean temperature was 3 degrees Celsius below the base temperature of 18°C (since 18°C - 15°C = 3). This means that heating was required to bring the indoor temperature up to a comfortable level. This measure helps in estimating the energy needed for heating on that day. The higher the "Degree Days" value, the more heating is required.

Degree days are not ordinary days, but a unit for calculation. In the Netherlands, the average temperature of a day is measured in De Bilt. If the average temperature is lower than 18 degrees, we speak of degree days. An average of 12 degrees includes (18-12=6) 6 degree days. No degree days are counted for any average temperature that is 18 degrees or higher. It is not the case that an average of 21 degrees is -3 degree days. An average above 18 degrees always counts as 0 degree days.

Weighted degree days.
The degree days are multiplied by a factor. It is of course the case that there is a lot of sunshine in the summer season. This also affects the temperature in the house, because the sun's rays heat up a house even more.

The weighting factor is different in the following parts of the year:
April to September: 0.8
March and October: 1.0
November to February: 1.1

Code in-depth:

Initialization: The code initializes a Spark session to handle data processing using PySpark.

Download and Extract Data: For each specified region, it downloads a zip file containing climate data from a given URL. The zip file is then extracted to obtain a text file.

Load Data into DataFrames: The text file is read into a Spark DataFrame, skipping the first 51 rows. The DataFrame is then processed to:
Select and rename necessary columns.
Convert date strings to date objects.
Convert temperature values from tenths of degrees Celsius to degrees Celsius.
Drop rows with missing temperature values.
Calculate “Degree Days” based on temperature and date, applying specific multipliers depending on the month.

Save Processed Data: The processed DataFrame for each region is saved as a CSV file in an “extracted_files” directory.

Display Recent Data: For each region, the most recent 31 records (a month) are sorted by date in descending order and displayed.

Potential: 
Add other regions so more data can be extracted from different places and potentially compared to other regions
